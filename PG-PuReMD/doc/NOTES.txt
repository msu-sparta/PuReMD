Changes to the original code. 

1. grid.c - changed the span from cell->cutoff to control->vlist_cut to
include all the cells for both native and non-native cells

2. in bond_orders.c, in the bond orders calculation, turned off the use of
bond_mark feature on both device and host.

3. Merged the THREE_BODY Fix, from Single GPU implementation to mGPU
implementation, to fix the three_body's generated per bond.

4. The valence_angles has a condition where I or J has to be less than "n" but
there is no restriction on K

so if we have (i>n j>n and k<n) we have a problem

this will NOT produce a 3 BODY. 

where as (i>n j<n and k>n) 
will produce a 3 BODY.

if we remove this condition, the number of three bodies are matching. 
Even the bonds are matching..... so this is the fix and get it working.

5. Updated the condition for sparse matrix generation

6. updated the condition for non bonded force calculations.
