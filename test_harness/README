#
# This folder contains a test harness to be used for verifying if later versions of the code are correct. It is designed to run on
# Michigan State University's Laconia cluster. Running it on other systems will require modification. 
#
# The test checks all three existing versions of the code (the original MPI-only PuReMD, PG-PuReMD, and PG-PuReMD with GPU functionality removed)  
# against each other. Each of these versions is put through 11 different benchmark systems, which are run for 100 cycles. 
#
# To easily start the test, one should use the following syntax while connected to dev-intel16-k80:
#
# ./sim_test_master.sh
#
# This script compiles all versions of the test and then submits several jobs to the queue.
# Be aware that this runs all benchmarks. It may be awhile before all these finish. For shorter tests, it might be better to comment out 
# portions of sim_test_master like the large 300000-atom systems. 
#
# Once all jobs have finished, if one desires to view all output in an ordered fashion to compare, the following script is available:
#
# ./sim_test_disp_output.sh
#
# If one wants to dump this output to a file:
#
# ./sim_test_disp_output > someoutputfile.txt
#
# If one wants to compare output to an older version, the file sim_output_082516.txt is available.
#
# For any questions please email Daniel Kortemeyer at korteme1@msu.edu
