# 1. Convert the pdb file to custom format which is an intermediate format
#    below is the awk command. Paste this command on the command line and 
#     change the file names appropriately.

awk '{if($1=="CRYST1") print "BOXGEO", $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7; if($1=="ATOM")
print $2, $3, $12, $6, $7, $8;}' <input-file>.pdb >& <output-file>.cus

#
# 2. Convert the custom format to geo format with the following command
#     replicate_geo.awk script can also be used to replicate the box in 
#     any of the x, y, z directions. They are set as 1, 1, 1 for now. 
#     If you want to replicate it, just change these numbers at the beginning
#    of the replicate_geo.awk file.

awk -f replicate_geo.awk <output-file>.cus > <output-flie>.water.geo


###
#
# 3. Open the geo file and insert a line below the BOXGEO line
#     BOXGEO is the very first line which contains the BOX geometry
#    The new line to be inserted contains the number of atoms in the
#     newly created geo file. This number should be equal to the 
#     total number of lines in the geo file - (2). one is the first line
#     which is the BOXGEO line and second one is for the newly inserted line.
