2015-present: Complete rewrite and rebrand as the PuReMD Reactive Molecular Dynamics (PuReMD) code.
      Added OpenMP code.
      Added optimized solvers for fluctuating charge models.
      Added fluctuating charge models (electronegativity equalization (EE), atom-condensed Kohn-Sham approximated to second order [ACKS2]).
      Removed broken single GPU CUDA code.
      Added MPI+HIP code (ported MPI+CUDA code).
      Added APIs and library builds for interfacing with other codebases.
      Added QM/MM functionality (shared-memory codes).
      Many bugfixes and other performance improvements.


2010: Version puremd_rc_1003 of the Purdue ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics (PuReMD) code. This code
      was previously available for download on the Purdue website and contained
      several versions: serial (sPuReMD), MPI (PuReMD), single GPU CUDA (PuReMD-GPU),
      and MPI+CUDA (PG-PuReMD).
